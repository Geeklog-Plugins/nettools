Install/Upgrade/Uninstall instructions for the Geeklog NetTools Plugin v2.1.1+ 

These instructions assume you have installed a Geeklog plugin before.

You must be using at least Geeklog version v2.2.0 and PHP 7.2.0 to install this plugin.


INSTALL/UPGRADE:

Step 1:  No need to back up your Geeklog Database as this plugin does not add any tables.

Step 2:  Either A) Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and upload the plugin using the Geeklog upload functionality found in the Admin Plugins page. If you do this, skip to Step 7, OR B) Go to Step 3.

Step 3:  Uncompress the NetTools Plugin archive from the path.to.geeklog/plugins directory.  The archive will create a directory called "nettools" in the plugins directory.

Step 4:  Create the public_html directory.  Under your html directory (usually public_html) create a directory called "nettools".

Step 5:  From the path.to.geeklog/plugins/nettools/ directory, copy the files and directories in the public_html directory to the public_html/nettools/ directory your created in Step 4.

Step 6:  Log in to your Geeklog as a root user and visit the Admin Plugins page.  For new installs look at the list of Uninstalled Plugins and you should fine the NetTools Plugin listed. Click the install button. For upgrades, look at the plugin list, there should be an upgrade button visible that you can press to start the upgrade process. 

Once installed/upgraded a success message will be displayed. If not examine Geeklog's logs/error.log for possible problems.

Step 7:  The NetTools Plugin should now be installed and functioning.  From your User Functions block, click on the NetTools link and it will take you to the NetTools page.

Step 8:  All root users will have access to the features of the NetTools Plugin since they belong to the Nettools Admin group. If you wish other users to have access, either add them to this user group or create/use another user group (that the user belongs too) and give that group one or more of the following security rights:

- Whois.view
- NSLookup.view
- Ping.view
- Tracert.view


UNINSTALL:

Step 1:  From the Admin Plugins page, you can uninstall the NetTools Plugin by clicking on the Delete button.

Step 2:  You then must manually delete the two plugin directories created in the install process:  
<geeklog-dir>plugins/nettools/ 
<public_html>/nettools/

----------------------------------------------------


Upgrading: If you are running one of Tom's versions of this plugin (lower than v2.1.1) and want to
upgrade to this new version, please follow these steps:

- disable the plugin
- remove the 3 plugin directories entirely, i.e.
  * /path/to/geeklog/plugins/nettools
  * /path/to/geeklog/public_html/nettools
  * /path/to/geeklog/public_html/admin/plugins/nettools
- upload the new plugin version (manually or through Geeklog's plugin upload)
  Note that the new version doesn't have an "admin" directory any more!
- re-enable the plugin
- you should see an update note now, so update the plugin

A lot of files have changed and have been added or removed in this version, so
the above steps will ensure you will have a clean update.

Geeklog NetTools Plugin
Tom Willett
Sept. 30, 2004

Note the only change is to upgrade the whois script to phpWhois the successor to Whois2

The NetTools plugin makes some basic network tools available in the Geeklog framework.  It consists of 4 tools:  Whois, 
NSLookup, Ping and TraceRoute.  The Whois implementation is based on the GPL phpWhois 3.05.  Future changes to phpWhois
should be a direct drop in replacement.  See (http://www.easydns.com/~markjr/whois2/).  

There are five pages of interest to the user of this plugin:
	nettools.php	A general page giving access to all of the tools the user has access to.
	whois.php	Like all the tool pages it handles both input and output.  If called directly it presents a
			form to enter in an address or domain to lookup.  If called with variables it presents the 
			result of the query.
	nslookup.php	Does a simple nslookup of an ip or domain name.  As a bonus, if run on a linux server, it will
			also display the Mail (MX) record if it is available.
	ping.php	Pings an address or website.  By default it only pings 4 times.  The ping page waits until the 
			external ping command returns, before displaying anything.  (Note:  unlike normal php pages a
			php page waiting for an external command will wait forever for command to return).
	tracert.php	Displays the route to a website or address.  It behaves like the ping page since it also calls an
			external command.

All of these pages reside in the nettools directory under public_html.

Since it is a plugin, it uses Geeklog security.  It creates 4 new security rights and assigns them to the Nettools.admin group. 
Each of the four tool pages has its own security right.  So whois.php has whois.view, ping.php has ping.view, etc.  If you want 
to be able to use only a subset of these tools you can make a restricted group that has only those tools in it.  If a user has 
rights to use any of the tools the plugin makes an entry in the user menu to the nettools.php page.  This page only shows those 
tools that the user has the right to use.

The reason I started looking into this tool set was to have a reliable source for whois for the stats plugin.  If you install this 
tool set you can enable the use of the whois by setting the Visitor Stats plugin whois variables like this:

$_ST_Whois_URL_start = '<a href="' . $_CONF['site_url'] . '/nettools/whois.php?domain=';
$_ST_Whois_URL_end = '" target="_blank">';


If you are doing this you probably want to add whois.view to the stats security group.  Besides having a reliable Whois service 
this also keeps you users onsite.

INSTALLATION:

1) Uncompress the archive in you /path to geeklog/plugins/ directory.  This will create a nettools directory.
2) Make two directories called nettools.  One under your public_html (public_html/nettools/) and one under the plugins directory
   under your admin directory (admin/plugins/nettools/).
3) Copy the files in the /path to geeklog/plugins/nettools/public_html/ directory to the public_html/nettools/ directory you made 
   earlier.
4) Copy the files in the /path to geeklog/plugins/nettools/admin/ directory to admin/plugins/nettools.
5) Run the install script at http://your.site/admin/plugins/nettools/install.php.
6) The install script does not make any tables, it only installs the security for the plugin.
7) Set up any security you want.

UNINSTALLATION:

1) Disable the plugin.
2) Run the uninstall script.
2) Delete the three directories named nettools.  ie.  plugins/nettools, public_html/nettools, admin/plugins/nettools.

Version 2.0 Changes
April 12, 2007

This version uses phpWhois 4.1.2  The documentation for this php class is the files that start with phpWhois.

You can speed up whois searches by changing the variable 
$whois->deep_whois = false;
in the whois.php file in public_html.


Enjoy.
